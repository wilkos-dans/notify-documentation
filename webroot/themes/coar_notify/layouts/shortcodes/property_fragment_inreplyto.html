#### `inReplyTo`
`inReplyTo` is specified because this is a response to a previous notification. `inReplyTo` MUST have:
* an `@id` which MUST be the URI (URN:UUID or HTTP URI) which identifies the `activity` for which this is a response.
* a `@type` array which mirrors the `@type` of the `activity` for which this is a response.
